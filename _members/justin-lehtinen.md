Justin is a Ph.D. student in biomedical engineering at the University of Minnesota (UMN). His previous master's work at the University of Minnesota used fluorescent imaging and histology to study the uptake of amphiphilic intranasal vaccine in the Hartwell Immunoengineering Lab. His undergraduate degree is in chemical engineering from the University of Kansas, where he worked in the Jennifer Robinson's Tare lab studying electrospinning fibrous scaffolds for wound healing. His current work is looking at studying new applications for an amphiphile vaccine platform to treat oral disease. In his free time, he likes to go rock climbing, cycling, and reading.
