I am a dentist scientist with an interest in host-microbe interactions and oral barrier immunity. I received DDS (2017) and PhD (2019) degrees, both from the UCLA School of Dentistry, for studying the role of host inflammation and the commensal microbiota in the pathogenesis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. I then joined as a Clinical Research Fellow at NIDCR/NIH in the laboratory of Dr. Niki Moutsopoulos. My main focus in the Moutsopoulos lab was to use systems immunology, applying single cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and high-dimensional cytometry to study mucosal immunology at the oral barrier, with a specific focus on understanding how the immune system contributes to the pathogenesis of common and mendelian forms of periodontal disease. I joined the faculty at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry in September 2024.
