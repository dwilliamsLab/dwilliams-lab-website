Shashwata is a postdoctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Oral Mucosal Immunology, where he focuses on T cell immunology and mucosal immune responses. Since his medical school, he has been interested in immunological studies. He earned his PhD in immunology from Kumamoto University, Japan, where he investigated mechanism of antibody development against conformational epitope (of HIV-1). His current work explores the role of T cells in oral mucosal health and disease, contributing to a deeper understanding of immune regulation at periodontitis site.
