Nejma is a student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities studying Human Physiology on the pre-dental track. In the future, she would like to provide restorative care to patients who cannot afford treatment and to reduce barriers to oral health care. She is interested in periodontal disease and oral wound healing, exploring how understanding the body’s physiological responses can improve dental treatments and patient outcomes. Nejma is also active on campus as a CLA ambassador, supporting prospective and current students. Outside of academics, she enjoys doing henna, reading, and taking long walks around Lake Harriet.
