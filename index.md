# Unraveling oral barrier immunity in mammalian health and disease

The relationship between the host and microbiota in barrier mucosal tissues is delicate and requires communication between microbes and host cells to initiate, adapt, and terminate responses in a manner that protects the host from infection and allows beneficial microbes to survive and thrive. Our lab is interested in understanding what governs host-microbe communication in health and disease at the oral barrier.

We develop and apply biologic tools that enable targeted study of host-microbe interactions at the oral barrier. Additionally, we use systems immunology to probe and characterize the oral barrier in different disease contexts.
